Will your project use sport as a tool for social change? 
</h3>

<p>
Comic Relief defines Sport for Change as bringing about positive social change for individuals and communities through the intentional use of sport and physical activity. Projects taking this approach should be able to demonstrate wider social outcomes and wonâ€™t just focus on increasing participation in sport for the physical health benefits.
