<h2>We don’t think you’re eligible.</h2>

<p>Our current initiatives will fund work in the UK, India, South Africa, Brazil and Kenya, so it’s unlikely that you’d get funding at this time.</p>

<p>Also, we don’t fund Core costs for organisations with a yearly income higher than 100.000£.
We will launch new initiatives in the coming months so keep an eye on our website and social media channels.</p>
